    <h3>Fibonacci Numbers</h3>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
        In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such
        that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
        <br>

        F(1)=1, F(0)=0
        <br>

        and
        <br>

        F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)
        <br>

        for n > 1.
        <br>
        <br>
        The sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
        <br>
        <br>
        Under some older definitions, the value F(0)=0 is omitted, so that the sequence starts with F(1)=F(2)=F(0) and
        the recurrence F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) is valid for n > 2. In his original definition, Fibonacci started the sequence
        with F(1)=2,F(2)=2 .
        <br>
        <br>

        Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the nth Fibonacci number
        in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the
        golden ratio as n increases.
        <br>
        <br>

        Fibonacci numbers are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci. In his
        1202 book Liber Abaci, Fibonacci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence
        had been described earlier in Indian mathematics, as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating possible
        patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths.
        <br>
        <br>

        Fibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that there is an entire journal dedicated
        to their study, the Fibonacci Quarterly. Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as
        the Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for
        interconnecting parallel and distributed systems.
        <br>
        <br>

        They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the
        fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern, and the arrangement of a pine
        cone's bracts.
        <br>
        <br>

        Fibonacci numbers are also closely related to Lucas numbers L(n), in that the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers form a
        complementary pair of Lucas sequences: Un(1,-1)=F(n) and Vn(1,-1)=L(n).
